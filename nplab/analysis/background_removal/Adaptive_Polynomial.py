"""
Program to iteratively remove a non-trivial background from a spectrum of peaks. Note that this is not a rapid process.

Author: Jack Griffiths 2017

METHOD:

This uses the adaptive polynomial method.

First, the spectrum is fit to a high order polynomial. We want this fit to use low weights around peaks and high weights otherwise, but everywhere
is initially equally weighted. The counts at each wavelength are taken as Poisson distributed with the fit value as the mean. The probabilities that 
the observed counts or higher would be seen in this case are calculated. This will be high for points below the fit and low for points above
the fit. These are used as weights for the next round of fitting. This continues until the fit converges.
